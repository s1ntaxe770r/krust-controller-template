# krust-controller-template 

a minimal template for creating kube controllers in rust

## Craates 

- kube-rs for kubernetes api

- tokio for async runtime

- anyhow for error handlingq

- env_logger for logging 


This is subject to change as I learn more about rust and kubernetes controllers and what patterns work best.
